## Endogenous
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_and_endogenous_variables) a variable whose measure is determined by the model

In other words, an endogenous variable is synonymous with a dependent variable, meaning it correlates with other factors within the system being studied. Therefore, its values may be determined by other variables.

## Exogeneous
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_and_endogenous_variables) a variable whose measure is determined outside the model and is imposed on the model

### My definition
If this were a PPL model its the outside data that we don't have control over
