## Endogenous
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_and_endogenous_variables) a variable whose measure is determined by the model

From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endogenous-variable.asp) An endogenous variable is a variable in a statistical model that's changed or determined by its relationship with other variables within the model. 
In other words, an endogenous variable is synonymous with a dependent variable, meaning it correlates with other factors within the system being studied. Therefore, its values may be determined by other variables. 

### My definition
If this were a PPL model its a change in a variable, or derministic, that we've defined

## Exogeneous
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exogenous_and_endogenous_variables) a variable whose measure is determined outside the model and is imposed on the model

### My definition
If this were a PPL model its the outside data that we don't have control over


## Random Process
A random process is a process that can be repeated many times with different outcomes each time.
